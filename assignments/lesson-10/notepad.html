<!--Things that I need to change: viewport size for images, and alignment on the form-->

Change image sizes in the gallery page and validate each page. Fix the image on the home page.

Hi Jeremy!

Great job creating your website! I like the name of it! :) It has a consistent feel throughout, nice descriptive headings. 
The fonts are the same size and the spacing is good. There were a couple of things that I think could make it have better usability.

As I was inspecting your alt tags, 
I realized that the ones in the home page and in each of the town pages are probably not descriptive enough. 
I realized that I also made the same mistake on my own site. 
What if instead of alt ="Hero Image" or alt="Preston Photo" you name your photos something more descriptive of what's going on with the picture? 
For example you hero image could be alt=" U.S. map" and the image for the Preston Town data could be alt="pretty trees", etc... 
I hope I'm explaining myself. This would help a blind person understand the picture even more. :) 

Also, try to create a link for "www.hsentinels.com" in your footer, and make sure to personalize it (different font color and hover effect). 
I think you need to have at least one personalized link in your page.

In your Storm Center, I would suggest to line things up to the left and making all your input spaces the same size. 
It would improve the readability that way. 
This should be an easy CSS fix. Just make sure to target the form input, select and text area and give it a width: 100%. 
That should also help to make it more responsive. 

I'm not an expert... but as far as usability goes, I think these suggestions could help you improve the quality of your site.

Again, great job! I think we've all come a long way this semester! :)
